      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Most related products in the market focus on inspection rather than
        cleaning of underground pipes. Products such as EnviroSight Rovver X and
        SuperVision carry complex and expensive camera technology, which
        increases the size of architecture. Other less intelligent products
        include manual drain snakes, which are inserted through plug holes.
        Others include drain cleaning machines, sink machines and drum machines.
        These devices perform designated actions and are rather inflexible. In
        addition, they are expensive (200-500 pounds) and require operators on
        sight. They have limited functionality in regards to cleaning of
        underground pipes. A vehicle that can perform autonomous cleaning and be
        controlled by customers independently is still a novel concept.</p>
